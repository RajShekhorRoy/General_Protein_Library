# General Protein Library (GPL)

This is an open-source Library to aid the development of tools for protein-related study. I plan to update and make changes as my hobby and if you want to contribute, go ahead.



















<h1>Cite</h1> 

I have developed most of it working on 2 of my projects, so if you find this helpful and want to cite, then cite these 2 papers:
1. Combining pairwise structural similarity and deep learning interface contact prediction to estimate protein complex model accuracy in CASP15
2.  A deep dilated convolutional residual network for predicting interchain contacts of protein homodimers
