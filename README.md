This is an open-source Library to aid the development of tools for protein-related study. 




I have developed most of it working on 2 of my projects, so if you find this helpful and want to cite, then cite this 2 papers:
1. Combining pairwise structural similarity and deep learning interface contact prediction to estimate protein complex model accuracy in CASP15
2.  A deep dilated convolutional residual network for predicting interchain contacts of protein homodimers
